[Verse]
Now I'm knee-deep in this mess
I could cry just thinking about you
Every line I write is something about you
Every guy I want looks something just like you
Every book I read, I only read for you
Every art piece is just to remind you
I don't know who I am, with or without you
But I guess I'm 'bout to find out
