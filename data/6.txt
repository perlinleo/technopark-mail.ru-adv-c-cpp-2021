[Verse 1]
Hey, you
Where you been hanging out lately? (You)
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger?
Feelin' alive, a teenager, ooh
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here you are

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna go wild
I just wanna fuck shit up and just ride
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just wanna sing loud
I just wanna lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Or in his arms tonight

[Chorus]
Hey, my lil' rager teenager
Tryna figure it out
Living a season of screaming
And turning it out
Hey, my little rager teenager
I've missed you around, yeah
Missed you around

[Verse 2]
Hey, you
Where you been hanging out lately? (You)
Sleeping and spending nights, wasting time
Never thought I'd see you again in my life
Why you been acting like a stranger?
Feelin' alive, a teenager, ooh
Feels kinda cool in the rager and I
Never thought I'd see the day in my life
Yet here we are, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna go wild (Wild, wild)
I just wanna do some shit just to try
In your car tonight
In your bed tonight
I just wanna sing loud
I just wanna lose myself in a crowd
In your arms tonight
Or in his arms tonight

[Chorus]
Hey, my lil' rager teenager
Tryna figure it out
Living in a season of screaming
And turning it out
Hey, my little rager teenager
I've missed you around, yeah
Missed you around
