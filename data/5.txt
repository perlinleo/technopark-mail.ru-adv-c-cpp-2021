[Verse 1]
Now we're adversaries in a pretty house, yeah
Couldn't tell you what we're even fight 'bout, yeah
That's probably something we should figure out, yeah
Ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

[Verse 2]
With infatuation fading in and out, yeah
Gotta find a piece that keeps us sticking 'round, yeah
I should say I don't have a shred of doubt, yeah
We're alright, 'cause

[Chorus]
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)

[Bridge]
There will be dark days, ooh
Swear that they'll be short
There will be good days, ooh
There'll be so many more
You can always be sure that

[Chorus]
I wanna be a ten out of ten for you
Hit it out of the park
And I wanna be an amen to ya
When you're falling apart
And we're not what we used to be
But let's be what we are (Let's be what we are)
