[Chorus]
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, tough
What's it like to be so big and strong and so buff?
Everything I'm not
But could I still be a hunk to you?
Enough for you, a stud to you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse]
Taking the fun out of fucks
Searching for something I'm not
Knowing that you're not the one
(You're the one for right now, yeah)
How much of me would you take?
And how much of me would you change?
On second thought, don't say a thing
('Cause you're the one for right now)

[Pre-Chorus]
Just let me believe that
You like what you're seeing
When you're looking at me
And your heartbeat is speeding
At seven hundred miles down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eating
Yeah

[Chorus]
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh)
(Stud, stud)
(Oh)

[Chorus]
Hey, stud
You can come and you can come
And meet me out front
You got all the muscles and the features I want
And I want what I want, my love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
You're into this, right?
We should do this right
You can make my night
We should do this right
You're into this, right?
We should do this right
You can make my night
We should do this, right?
Right?

[Outro]
Just let me believe that
You like what you're seeing
When you're looking at me
And your heartbeat is speeding
The seven hundred miles
Down highways to Eden
Like my body's the apple you're eating
Yeah
You're into this (Mmm)
We should do this (Mmm)
You're into this (Mmm)
You can make my night (Mmm)
You're into this, right?
You can make my night
You're into this, right?
You can make my night
You're into this
My night
Mmm
